A cartoony occult platformer where you race against time to deliver human sacrifices. Originally developed for [Ludum Dare 50.](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/rat-king) The game did very well, and ranked in the top 50 of all submissions for the jam.

We hope to update the game in the future with more levels and gameplay improvements.
