MAIN MECHANICS
- Tie-in to main theme
  - Must sacrifice people to rat king to prevent invasion of evil rat people
  - As game progresses and you sacrifice more people, show fewer and fewer "innocent" civilians
  - Suggests that you'll eventually run out of sacrifices and you're DELAYING THE INEVITABLE invasion of rat people
  - Big visual indicators as you progress through levels

- Sacrifices
  - At the start of each level, rat king requests certain people as sacrifices
  - On a timer to sacrifice everyone on the menu
  - IF WE HAVE TIME: Timer could be vague and only shown by parallax + HUD element, adds to sense of urgency
    - Just use simple text popup for time being
  - Can have certain characteristics or can be a specific person
  - Sacrificing the wrong person can give you a time penalty

- Levels
  - Sacrifice chamber is the center of each level
  - Rest of the level (city) expands out around that
  - Ideally levels are pretty short and plentiful

- Sack
  - Can hold 3 citizens at once
  - Grab people automatically
  - Sack gets heavier with more citizens - slows you down
  - Weight of sack can help solve puzzles
    - Break through certain walls with heavier sacks
    - Pressure plates that can only be activated by sacks enough people in them
  - Holding the sack can garner suspicion from cops - if you get busted you're done for
  - Hold left mouse: Aim and throw bag (can't throw empty bag)
    - Yoshi's Island style tracking

- Movement
  - Fast and frantic movement speed
  - No health: one-hit-kills, shitty little cultist man
  -
